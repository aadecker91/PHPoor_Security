THis is code for an intentionally vulnerable web application project that is also my senior project at the University of Florida.

It will demonstrate the top 10 vulnerabilities of 2013 based upon the OWASP top ten project:

Injections
Session Management
Cross Site Scripting

Currently it consists of the layout and framework for the site.
